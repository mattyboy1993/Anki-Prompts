I'd like to learn more about tolkien's works, specifically the hobbit and the lord of the rings by using Anki. I have read both pieces of writing, but I can have trouble remembering parts of the stories. Given these are both big works, especially the lord of the rings, could you help me develop a plan on how to segment this up for the creation of flashcards focus on spaced repition learning? I'd like it mainly focused on the texts themselves, along with some background info on tolkien and his thought process for writing these books. We can also have signigifant commentary be a section. Also can have a section on how the movies compare and differ from the books.

Parent Deck: Tolkien's Legendarium

Sub-Deck 1: The Hobbit

Sub-Deck 2: The Lord of the Rings (This will itself contain sub-decks)

Sub-Deck 3: Author & Worldbuilding

Sub-Deck 4: Literary Analysis & Commentary

Sub-Deck 5: Adaptations: Book vs. Film

Detailed Breakdown of Each Sub-Deck
Here is a detailed plan for what kind of cards should go into each deck.

1. Deck: The Hobbit
This is your starting point. The narrative is more linear and serves as an excellent foundation.

Objective: Master the plot progression, key characters, locations, and significant items of The Hobbit.

Segmentation: Create cards on a chapter-by-chapter basis. After reading a chapter, create cards for its key events before moving on.

Card Types & Examples:

Character Identification:

Front: "Leader of the Dwarven company seeking to reclaim Erebor."

Back: "Thorin Oakenshield"

Plot Points:

Front: "What riddle does Bilbo ask Gollum that ultimately stumps him?"

Back: "'What have I got in my pocket?'"

Locations:

Front: "What is the name of the Elven settlement in the valley of Rivendell?"

Back: "The Last Homely House"

Quotes (using Cloze Deletion):

Front: "Said by {{c1::Smaug}}: 'My armour is like tenfold shields, my teeth are swords, my claws spears...'"

2. Deck: The Lord of the Rings
This is the largest section. Do not try to tackle it all at once. The most logical way to segment it is by the six "books" that Tolkien originally intended, plus the Appendices.

Create Sub-Decks within The Lord of the Rings:

Book I: The Ring Sets Out

Book II: The Ring Goes South

Book III: The Treason of Isengard

Book IV: The Ring Goes East

Book V: The War of the Ring

Book VI: The End of the Third Age

The Appendices

For each Book (I-VI), follow the same chapter-by-chapter strategy as with The Hobbit, focusing on:

Detailed Plot: Track the movements of the sundered Fellowship.

(Book III) Front: "Whom do Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli meet in Fangorn Forest, believing him at first to be Saruman?"

(Book III) Back: "Gandalf the White"

Character Arcs: Note significant moments of character development.

(Book IV) Front: "What crucial act of 'pity' does Samwise Gamgee show towards Gollum outside Shelob's Lair?"

(Book IV) Back: "He gives Gollum back the second rabbit, even though he is disgusted by him."

Geography & Travel: Trace the paths of the characters.

(Book II) Front: "What is the name of the Elven realm ruled by Galadriel and Celeborn?"

(Book II) Back: "Lothlórien"

Songs & Poems: Note the title and a key line or theme.

(Book I) Front: "The poem 'All that is gold does not glitter...' is about which character?"

(Book I) Back: "Aragorn"

For the The Appendices Deck:
This is for deep lore. Break it down by appendix section.

(Appendix A) Front: "Who was the first King of the North-kingdom (Arnor)?"

(Appendix A) Back: "Elendil"

(Appendix B) Front: "In what year of the Third Age was the Fellowship of the Ring formed at Rivendell?"

(Appendix B) Back: "T.A. 3018"

3. Deck: Author & Worldbuilding
This deck focuses on the "why" behind the story.

Objective: To understand J.R.R. Tolkien's life, his academic background, and his philosophical approach to creating Middle-earth.

Source Material: Biographies (like Humphrey Carpenter's J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography), and especially The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien.

Card Types & Examples:

Biographical:

Front: "Tolkien was a professor of what subject at Oxford University?"

Back: "Anglo-Saxon (Old English)"

Inspiration:

Front: "Tolkien's traumatic experience at what WWI battle deeply influenced his portrayal of warfare and fellowship?"

Back: "The Battle of the Somme"

Linguistic Creation:

Front: "Which of Tolkien's invented languages, intended to sound like 'Latin-ish,' was developed first and most fully?"

Back: "Quenya (High-Elven)"

Conceptual (from Letters):

Front: "In his letters, Tolkien identified the central theme of The Lord of the Rings as {{c1::Death and Immortality}}."

4. Deck: Literary Analysis & Commentary
Here you move from fact to interpretation.

Objective: To engage with the major themes, literary devices, and critical reception of the works.

Source Material: Your own thoughts, critical essays, and books about Tolkien's work (e.g., Tom Shippey's The Road to Middle-earth).

Card Types & Examples:

Themes:

Front: "Define Tolkien's concept of 'eucatastrophe' and provide one example from the text."

Back: "A sudden, joyous turn of events that is unexpected and miraculous. Example: The destruction of the Ring at the Crack of Doom just as Frodo claims it."

Motifs:

Front: "What is the significance of the motif of 'pity' (e.g., Bilbo's for Gollum, Frodo's for Gollum, Gandalf's for Saruman)?"

Back: "It is the central moral virtue that enables grace and provides the opportunity for redemption. Bilbo's pity is directly responsible for the quest's eventual success."

Critical Views:

Front: "What was a common early critique of The Lord of the Rings from the literary establishment?"

Back: "That it was escapist, childish, and not serious literature."

5. Deck: Adaptations: Book vs. Film
This is where you analyze the choices made in Peter Jackson's film adaptations.

Objective: To identify and analyze the key differences, omissions, and additions between the books and the films.

Card Types & Examples:

Omissions:

Front: "Which character, who represents a powerful, enigmatic nature outside the struggle for power, is completely absent from the Peter Jackson films?"

Back: "Tom Bombadil"

Character Changes:

Front: "How does the film portrayal of Faramir's initial reaction to Frodo and the Ring differ from the book?"

Back: "In the film, he is tempted and takes the hobbits to Osgiliath. In the book, he resists temptation immediately, saying he 'would not take this thing, if it were lying by the highway.'"

Plot Additions:

Front: "The entire sequence of Arwen rescuing Frodo from the Nazgûl and summoning the flood was an addition to the film. Who performed this role in the book?"

Back: "Frodo rode alone (on Glorfindel's horse), and the flood was summoned by Elrond and Gandalf."
