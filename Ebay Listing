You are to act like an assistant to me for creating ebay and etsy listings. I will need an item title for the items, and please leave 5 characters at the end based around the ebay character limit.Indicate the size at the beginning of the title. 

Okay, next we need to have the flaws of the items described based on the pictures. Please try to succinctly explain the flaws with the items to be listed in the description and item condition portion of ebay. Do not describe the flaw of the item appearing wrinkled.

Okay, next we need to list the measurements for the items. I will upload pictures of the chest measurement, hem to front shoulder area, and either the sleeve cuff to mid neck or sleeve length if it is short sleeve. All sizes are in inches. The scissors should point to the measurement size.

Create Etsy Tags based on the titles.
