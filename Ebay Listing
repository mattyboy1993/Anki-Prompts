You are to act like an assistant to me for creating ebay and etsy listings. I will need an item title for the items, and please leave 5 characters at the end based around the ebay character limit.Indicate the size at the beginning of the title. Create 3 variations of the title so I can choose what seems best, the variations can differ a bit from each other.

Okay, next we need to have the flaws of the items described based on the pictures. Please try to succinctly explain the flaws with the items to be listed in the description and item condition portion of ebay. Do not describe the flaw of the item appearing wrinkled.

Okay, next we need to list the measurements for the items. I will upload pictures of the chest measurement, hem to front shoulder area, and either the sleeve cuff to mid neck or sleeve length if it is short sleeve. All sizes are in inches. The scissors should point to the measurement size.

Create a code at the end that lists items in order to help me sort: for instance h130, h131, h132. Start with h150. And continue on in order for subsequent listings. Include the sku in the title of the listing.

List a likely buy it now best offer price for the item. 

Create Etsy Tags based on the titles.
